How to create minimal wasm module - PoC

## Goals

- use no Emscripten or other libs
- simple toolchain, compile to wasm in a single step 
- wasm may use memory prepared in JavaScript
- do something relative compute-intensive
- do something visible

# Final word

Writing web app in any language
which is not JavaScript is just 
pure joy
